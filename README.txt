# Pinephone-USB-Superpowers
Do what you need via USB (Get internet from PC like gnirehtet, Share phone internet to PC, Send keypresses, use like Ventoy to boot ISO, etc)
For something like scrcpy (android on pc with controls), vnc already will do the job?

# Goals:
PHONE -> PC Internet
PC Internet -> Phone
Phone Keyboard -> PC
 \- Also for preset or clipboard content to automatically type in to PC (For example paste password in app and it will be typed out in PC)
Phone as Ventoy-like tool to boot ISO on PC

(Unsure) Phone touch / mouse -> PC mouse (kde connect vibes)
